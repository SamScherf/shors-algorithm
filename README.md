# Shor's Algorithms
This is going to be a fully function implementation of Shor's algorithms using Qiskit

## Usage
Eventually upon running the program, the user will be prompted for a number and the program will return
to the user what hardware would be required to factor that number. If desired, the user can then
simulate that hardware using Qiskit's Aer simulator on their classical machine and see the results

## Implementation
The implementation itself is still yet to come, this version is just a starting point

## Dependencies
This program requires the Qiskit, matplotlib, and pylatexenc which can all be installed with the following command

```
pip install qiskit matplotlib pylatexenc
```
